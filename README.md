# statRdaysCFB
Work With The Collegefootballdata.com API, Easily

This package will allow you to easily interact with the cfbdata API without having to worry about the boring stuff.

## Getting Started

Install the package using
``` r
devtools::install_github("kylebennison/statRdaysCFB")
```

Load it using
``` r
library(statRdaysCFB)
```

The first thing you need to do is set your API key to your environment. Do this using
``` r
set_cfb_api_key("yourkeygoeshere")
```

If you don't have an API key, you'll need to request one first from collegefootballdata.com/key. They're free!
